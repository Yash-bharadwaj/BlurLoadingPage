# BlurLoadingPage

**Blur Loading Page**

This project is a web page that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a blur loading effect. When the page is accessed, it initially displays a blurred version of the content and gradually transitions to the clear, fully loaded state. The purpose of this project is to provide a visually appealing loading experience for website visitors.

**Features**

Blurred content: Upon accessing the page, the content is displayed with a blur effect, creating a sense of anticipation.

Smooth transition: The blur effect gradually diminishes as the page elements load, resulting in a seamless transition to the final clear state.

Customizable settings: The project's JavaScript file includes configurable variables that allow you to adjust the loading speed, blur intensity, and other parameters to suit your preferences.

**Usage**
